# FinalProjectCS2000
Creating a text file that provides class information for a Computer Science student's preferred start date and class level

This project demonstrates the ability to read through an input file containing course information for the Fall of 2023.  It filters by user input determining what day of the week they would like to start the class (a Monday or Tuesday) and what
experience level they are at (1000, 2000, 3000, 4000).  Finally, it provides a .txt file (YourClassList.txt) which outputs all the class information fitting their parameters in a readable, organized manner.

I demonstrated the following features in completing this project:
    
    +1 for using inheritance in the form of a derived class (OfferedCourse) with various variables that separate it from its base class (Course), the latter of which can differ from semester to semester.
    
    +1 for using a new file (CoursesFall2023UnderscoreReplace.txt) modified from the original data file (CoursesFall2023Tab.txt), one which I parsed, evaluated, modified, and organized in a readable manner for the user in an output text file (YourClassList.txt).
    
    +1 for using a Dynamic array of OfferedCourse objects to store the data fitting both the start day and course level parameters separate from the original vectors organizing courses only by start days.
    
    +1 for putting my code in this github account and emailing it to professor Trovato.
